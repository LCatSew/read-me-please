# read-me-please

## Description
    
- I was motivated to create a README.md generator to make  writing those files faster and easier
- I built this project so it would take different factors into account and build a custom README.md file for me, with limited edits needing to be made.
- This solves the problem of spending precious time writing READMEs for assignments that could be spent focusing on studying and learning the material.
- I learned how to include packages for an application, instantiate properties, use the inquirer package to prompt for inputs, checkboxes, lists, and so much more!
- I faced a few challenges with this assignment.  First, I had to learn to call for a prompt based on the user's selection/confirmation of a previous prompt. I also had trouble being able to answer prompts in the command line when I wasn't using the promises-based 'fs' module.

## Installation

First, you will need to clone the code locally. Once you have done that, cd into the 'Developer' directory. Lastly, run "npm i" to install the dependencies required. Once that is done, run "node index.js" in the command line and you will be given a series of prompts to answer. Once completed, this will generate the README.md file.

## Usage

Make sure to answer all questions using full sentence structure. This will give you the best possible result. I would also recommend reviewing the file once it is generated and tweaking it to add any images, tables, etc. so it is fully fleshed out. For example, this README.md file was generated using this project! However, I cannot upload images into the command line, so that is something I had to add after the fact.
